=subject Is a value IN a given list of values?

Hi,

I am sorry if I am even less coherent than usual, but I was up
till 4 am yesterday trying to set up the index page of the
Perl 6 Maven site.

As probably usual it did not work out, but after having a
few hours sleep I managed to finish it. It's not something
very interesting, I just united the index from the tutorial
http://perl6maven.com/tutorial/ and from the regular pages
of the the site into a single index page: http://perl6maven.com/index

The post of today is an updated version of an earlier post. It starts
out as a simple problem, but then uses the opportunity to show the
new form of the ternary operator and junctions.
