=subject Perl 6 files

Hi there,

A quick message as I am already in Germany, 
with both hands in Perl.

The article today is about reading and writing files in Perl 6:

  http://perl6maven.com/perl6-files

Thanks a lot to those who sent me their question regarding Perl 6,
some really useful issues there that will be addressed later.

As I am going to see some of the core Perl 6 developers,
it would be awesome if you could send me your questions and
concerns regarding Perl 6.


   Gabor
