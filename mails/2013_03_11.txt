=subject Comments on the Perl 6 tutorial

hi,

as you might have noticed, I did not have a lot of time
to do anything Perl 6 related in the last couple of months.

I was mostly focusing on getting the Perl 5 Maven site
http://perl5maven.com/ more popular, and that seems to
be working.

So maybe I'll have some time again to turn my attention
to Perl 6 as well.


Perl 6 Maven broken and fixed
===============================

Yesterday I rebuilt Rakudo which broke the Perl 6 Maven site.
If you are following the RSS feed of the site then you might
have noticed the breakage. Sorry for that.

I had code that looked like this:

   qq{ Title: { $page.title } }

This worked on earlier versions of Rakudo, but apparently that
was a bug. As I understood from a little chat in the IRC channel
is that if I want to use the {} statement interpolation in a string,
then I cannot use curly braces as the delimiters for qq.

According to this Rakudo was broken earlier and I used this broken 
feature so my code only worked by accident.

I had to fix my code:

   qq[ Title: { $page.title } ]

This was of course frustrating, but on the other hand no other part
of my code got broken in the past 6 months, so Rakudo might be
quite stable.


Perl 6 Maven: Comments on the tutorials
========================================

Earlier I had comments enabled on the articles only,
but not on the pages of the tutorial. Today I enabled
the comments there too. I hope you will use it.


Hello World
============
Instead of writing totally new articles I am going to add more
detailed text to the tutorial pages.

The first one I attacked was the "Hello World" example:

     http://perl6maven.com/tutorial/perl6-hello-world

enjoy

ps. I also added the social icons to the tutorial pages.
It seems that Google takes in account all the +1-s a page
receives via Google+. So if you like a page, please
click on the G+1 icon on the right hand side.
