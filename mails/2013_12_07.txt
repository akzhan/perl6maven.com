=subject Perl 6 Advent calendar and Rakudo 2013.11

Hi there!

Long time no mail.

In the last year or so, I hardly had any time to follow
the development of Perl 6, but there is a little project
I am planning to write in Perl 6 now, so last month I
started to check again.


Getting started with Rakudo * 2013.11
======================================

Specifically I tried to set up my environment with Rakudo 2013.10
Unfortunately some modules were missing from that distribution.

Then I tried it again with the 2013.11 release. There again I
bumped into a problem, that panda, the "cpan client" of Perl 6
did not work. This was due to a server problem, but I decided
I'll just bite the bullet and rewrite the script generating
the Perl 6 Maven site to use Template::Mojo that already
comes with Rakudo *.

Once I did that I could re-generate the main pages of the
site, but then I found out I need another module, one that
does not come with Rakudo *, to rebuild the tutorial part.

That's a very basic and probably very incorrect XML parser
I wrote in Perl 6 a while ago. I did not really had to 
install it as I could just tell perl6 to look for it
in another place using the -I command line flag.

(Yes, I could have done the same with the Templating system,
but I realized this only after I already rewrote that part.)

Anyway, it turned out the XML parser stopped working since
I last ran it in February. Luckily Tobias Leich (FROGGS)
helped me in the Perl 6 IRC channel and fixed that XML module.

Armed with all this I could re-generate the site and publish
the new article on how to get started with Rakudo 2013.11:

Perl 6 Advent Calendar
==============================

Some parts of the tech community like to celebrate Christmas
by preparing an Advent Calendar. This basically means they 
write an article every day from 1st December till 24 December.
More-or-less.

The Perl 6 Advent calendar can be found here:

https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/

It even has a table of contents:

enjoy!
