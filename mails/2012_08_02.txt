=subject Looping over a list of values one at a time, two at a time and more

Hi again,

I've heard that some people reading the articles published
on the Perl 6 Maven site got to #perl6 IRC channel and started
to get involved. This is awesome! Keep doing it.

This reminds me that one of my objectives with the Perl 6 Maven
site is to enlarge the circle of people who are learning, and
starting to use Perl 6.

The question how?

Or maybe who?

Who do you think could be interested in Perl 6?

Today's article is about iterating over elements of lists, arrays, hashes also
introducing the big Z. No it is neither Zorro nor Zorg.
