=subject Learn X in Y minutes

I just noticed an earlier mail from Liz (aka. Elizabeth Mattijsen ) linking to this page:

http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/perl6/

It is a nice resource if you'd like to get up-to-speed in Perl 6 and you only have Y minutes.

In other news, one of the readers asked me if there is a binary distribution of Rakudo Star
for Linux. As I don't know about any (other) such thing and as I already have the one
I built for the Travis-CI integration ( http://perl6maven.com/continuous-integration-for-perl6-modules-using-travis-ci )
I figured it would not hurt to create a page for it on the DWIM Perl web site:

http://dwimperl.com/perl6.html

So in case you don't want to compile Rakudo Star for yourself you can use this.
