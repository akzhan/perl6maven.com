=subject Perl 6 subroutines and home made operators

hi,

this is the return of some videos!

I started to go over the old Perl 6 video recordings to see which one
is still relevant, which one needs a little fixing and which one do
I need to throw out.

Today's article includes some explanation on subroutine definitions
and creating the thought operator so you'll be able to write

People who are frequent to the #perl6 IRC channel will recognize the expression.

The article with the embedded video is here:

The video needed some annotation as there are a few places where the
old code needs some fixing.


Enjoy
   Gabor
