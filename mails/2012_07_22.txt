=subject How to test Perl 6 modules and scripts?

Hi,

a couple of days ago the core Rakudo and Perl 6 developer
asked around how should they handle breakages across
versions of Rakudo. They are not yet declaring it to
be "stable" or "production" version, but they would like
to make it easier for people to start writing Perl 6 code
*and* to ensure relatively smooth upgrade.

Some of the responses on PerlMonks made me think people
somehow accept the fact that all the dynamic languages
(Python, PHP, Ruby and even Perl 5) have broken backward
compatibility to some extent.

Even if that was "just" to fix a potential security hole.

OTOH they expect Rakudo and Perl 6 to be "stable".

I ranted about this a bit on my blog
http://szabgab.com/looking-for-a-stable-language.html
but eventually the only reasonable solution
I know is to write lots of automatic tests and run
them both before and after upgrade.

To make it easier I wrote an article

    How to test Perl 6 modules and script?

ps. The articles on Perl 6 Maven now have 3 social buttons
Reddit, Twitter and Google+.

Don't forget to share the article with your
followers/circles/friends/etc. It will help to spread the
word about Perl 6 and make me happy too :)
