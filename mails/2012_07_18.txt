=subject From Iterative to Functional Perl 6 Code

Hi,

this is the first guest post on Perl 6 Maven and I am really happy about it.

Moritz Lenz, a core developer of the Rakudo Perl 6 Compiler and a long time
Perl 6 blogger is showing how to locate a file in the filesystem
when you are unsure its location or its extension.

This is a simple example that can help concentrate on the Perl 6 features
he is showing that makes the solution interesting.

The article is here:
