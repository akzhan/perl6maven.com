=subject Reading from a file

hi,

Besides the article on reading from a file, that you can, err, read here:

    http://perl6maven.com/reading-from-a-file-in-perl6

there are a couple of announcements too:

The source of Perl 6 Maven in raw format
=========================================

I pushed the source files of the Perl 6 Maven articles
to Github.

    https://github.com/szabgab/perl6maven.com

So far this only contains the articles in their "source" format
which is a mix of POD, HTML, and XML, but I am also planning
to push out the source files of the Perl 6 tutorial I wrote
and that I should refresh:

    http://perl6maven.com/tutorial/

I am also planning to release the code that generates the site.
I just have to do some clean-up work before I dare to do it.


Searching the Perl 6 Maven site?
==================================

As I had a long break from Perl 6 I forgot almost everything I knew
so when I tried to read from a file I had to look for examples.
I could not find anything in the documentation of Perl 6 nor could
I find it (easily) on the Perl 6 Maven site. I needed a search and
added one.

On the navigation bar you will find a text-box, where you can type your
query. It is keyword based so only values that were added to the index
can be found (and as I just checked, even that might be a bit buggy),
but it is a start. Let me know how does it work (or not) for you,
and which keywords are you missing?
See

enjoy

ps. I know very few people are currently interested in Perl 6,
but I am sure a little more publicity will help. A bit.
So don't forget to share the above links on Google+, or on your favorite
social network.
