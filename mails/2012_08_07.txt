=subject Perl 6 subroutines

Hi there,

I am on a sort-of vacation spending a lot of hours in a
swimming pool and trying to rest in the rest of the time.
Nevertheless I am trying to move forward with the Perl 6
articles.

This time it is about subroutines.

They are way more complex and more powerful than in Perl 5:

though as a side effect I also introduce the reduction operator.

   Gabor
ps. I also added a warning to the pages telling
random visitors that this site is about Perl 6 and not Perl 5.
I should probably make it dependent on the (lack of) a cookie
so i'll be able to show it only to the random new visitor, and not
to the regular readers, like you.

What do you think about the wording?
