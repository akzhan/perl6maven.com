=subject Perl 5 to Perl 6 - Arrays

Hi there,

This is the second part in the Perl 5 to Perl 6 series.
This time we are looking at arrays and loops and a bit
about ranges ..

YAPC::EU
========

Next week I'll be in Germany at YAPC::EU,
where I am going to meet with most of the core
Perl 6 developers. I hope I'll be able to have a
conversation with about the future of Perl 6.

Guest posts
============

I'd also like to get at least some of them to
write guest posts for the Perl 6 Maven, but I am
sure they will ask me what should they write about?

So I'd like to get your opinion on this.
What kind of articles would *you* like to read?

regards
   Gabor
