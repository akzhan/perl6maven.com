=subject Is 2015 going to be the Year of Perl 6 ?

Hi there!

I have not published anything Perl 6 related for more than a year,
but just as last year, I have quickly published two articles today:


The technical one explain how to install the latest release of  Rakudo Perl 6
http://perl6maven.com/tutorial/perl6-installing-rakudo

In the non-technical one I ask:

Is 2015 going to be the year of Perl 6 ?
http://perl6maven.com/is-2015-going-to-be-the-year-of-perl6

Let's see what the answer will be?

Happy New Year!
