=subject Sending email using Perl 6

hi,

as far as I know there is no Perl 6 module yet for sending e-mail
so I wrote a subroutine to handle the task for this newsletter.

In this article I show it:

ps. A few days ago I wrote an article listing the most popular perl-related web sites
based on Alexa http://szabgab.com/most-popular-perl-sites.html
There is a section for Perl 6 related sites with the 4 top-most entries.
What other sites would you include in the list?
