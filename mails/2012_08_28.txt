=subject How to install Perl 6 modules

Wow, it has been almost 2 weeks since I sent the last message!

I hope you were all on vacation and did not miss any of the action.

I sent the previous message while I was already in Germany,
in a town called Perl, just 1 km from Schengen on the
German/Luxembourg/France border.

A couple of Perl 5 big shots and almost the entire Perl 6 development
team was there.

An me.

The 3-days meeting was called the

  Perl Reunification Summit

organized by Liz and Wendy ( Elizabeth Mattijsen and Wendy van Dijk).

The main subject was - how to get Perl 5 and Perl 6 talk to each other?

Both the compilers and the communities.

I am sure we are going to hear a lot about this meeting, and I hope
we'll see lots of results in a few months. In case you'd like to read
a bit more about this, here is what Liz wrote:

Compared to that, the current article is a bit pale and short.
I just described how can you install and use external modules
in Perl 6:
