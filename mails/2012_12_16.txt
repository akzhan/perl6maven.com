=subject The 2012 Perl 6 Coding Contest

hi,

as you might have noticed I did not have a lot of time
to do anything Perl 6 related in the last 3 months.
I hardly had time for any articles.

In the meantime I hope you have followed the Perl 6 Advent calendar.
If you have not done it, it is still not too late.
Visit http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/ and you'll already find 16 articles.


Anyway, I am sending this message as I just noticed that Carl Masak
has announced the 3rd annual Perl 6 Coding Contest.
It started 2 days ago, and will end on 18th January 2013.

You have 5 tasks to solve.

enjoy
   Gabor

ps. I think this can be a good excuse to improve your Perl 6 skills
and this could be a good project to extend invitation to your friends,
to try Perl 6.
