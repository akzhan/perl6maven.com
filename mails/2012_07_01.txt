=subject Read module documentation on-line

Hi,

first let me include some external news and then update
about the Perl Maven site.

The French Perl workshop ( http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2012/ )
was held during the last 2 days. Several Perl 6 developers
took part and gave presentations.
Despite this, we also saw the scheduled release of Rakudo *.


News
=====

Moritz Lentz has announced the June 2012 release of "Rakudo *".
---------------------------------------------------------------

It contains the latest release of the Rakudo compiler, Parrot,
some modules and documentation.

If you are learning Perl 6, this might be a good package
to start with.

For the detailed announcement, see

   http://rakudo.org/2012/06/30/rakudo-star-2012-06-released/


Carl MÃ¤sak describes the solution to Enumerating trees
---------------------------------------------------------------

This was the 5th, and final task in the Perl 6 Coding Contest 2011.

In a nutshell, you were supposed to draw all the different trees
with N nodes and N-1 vertices. Without duplications.

Stefan O'Rear announced the release of Niecza Perl 6 v19
---------------------------------------------------------------

Niecza is a Perl 6 compiler targeting the Common Language Runtime;
Both Mono and Microsoft .NET are known to work.

For details see

Update to the Perl 6 Maven site:
================================

As mentioned earlier, in addition to the articles I'll publish
about Perl 6, I am also trying to collect all the existing content
and display in a useful way.

Partially because *I* need them for exploring and using Perl 6,
but I hope this will be also useful for you too.

The first thing I was trying to display is the documentation
of the existing 3rd-party Perl 6 modules.

I based the information on what Panda supplies, processed
the POD using a naive and very partial POD parser
https://github.com/szabgab/perl6-Pod-Parser
and created the pages.

Visit the Perl 6 Maven web site and check out the links
"Projects" and "Authors". http://perl6maven.com/

If you find a module where the POD was not or was not
sufficiently parsed, please let me know or just file
a ticket for the Pod::Parser with the name of the module.
I'll try to fix those ASAP.

I would like to add some search capability to it and
a better display of the source code. Maybe even the
results of some code analysis, so people learning a
feature of the language could find examples how to
use that feature.

For now, that's it.

Enjoy!
