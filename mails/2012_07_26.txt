=subject How does interpolation of scalars, arrays and hashes work in Perl 6

Hi,

let me thank the people who shared the previous articles on Twitter or Google+.
It helps a lot reaching new people.

Special thanks to Patterner0 who posted the previous article on Reddit
http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/wyrlt/how_to_test_perl_6_modules_and_scripts/
This post brought in quite a number of visitors.


This new article is describing the variable interpolation in Perl 6
or "How to embed an expression in a string?"

Perl 6 Tutorial
================

A couple of days ago I move my old Perl 6 slides to the new site.
I went over the first 4 chapters to make sure the code works, though
I am sure there are a lot of things that need to be improved.

I published it under the link "Tutorial" on the site and I am
planning to turn it into something that is usable as a
Perl 6 tutorial. Please check it, and send me any comments you have.
