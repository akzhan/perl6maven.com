=subject Regexes in Perl 6 and commenting is enabled

Hi,

another article has been updated and moved to the Perl 6 Maven site:

   Perl 6 Regexes
   http://perl6maven.com/perl6-regexes

In addition I enabled commenting on the web site using the Disqus
commenting service.

Enjoy

Here is a question for you:

Currently there are 230 people subscribed to this newsletter.
Some of you click on the links I send and probably read the articles,
but many don't.

How can I make the articles more interesting so more people will read them?
