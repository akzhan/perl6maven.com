=subject Find Perl 6 modules without Travis CI

Hi,

Since the previous message a new version of Rakudo Start has been released ( http://rakudo.org/ )
and the Perl 6 site got a nice face lift: http://perl6.org/ .

I have published the "Perl Development Environment" a Vagrant/VirtualBox that has
the latest Perl 5 and Perl 6 environment:
http://perlmaven.com/vagrant-perl-development-environment

Today I wrote a small Perl 6 script that will locate the Perl 6 Modules on GitHub that are
not (yet) using Travis-CI for continuous integration: http://perl6maven.com/find-perl6-modules-without-travis-ci
59 out of th 71 modules do NOT use Travis-CI yet!

If you have some time and would like to contribute to Perl 6, then adding the .travis.yml file, making
sure the tests pass, and sending a pull requests might be a good idea.

regards
  Gabor
