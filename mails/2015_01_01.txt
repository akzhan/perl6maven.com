=subject Continuous Integration for Perl 6 modules using Travis-CI

Happy New Year!

Based on what Larry Wall wrote

http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/day-24-seeing-wrong-right/

we can expect Perl 6 to be officially released this year which means soon
thousands of people will start writing code in it. Those people will want
to have high quality and well tested modules.

So you, as an earlier adopter, can still make a huge impact on the speed of adoption
of Perl 6 by building some of the most wanted modules:
http://modules.perl6.org/

In order to make it easier to test your Perl 6 module I have created a set of shell
scripts that allow you to use Travis-CI to have Continuous Integration for
your Perl 6 module.

The article today explains how:
