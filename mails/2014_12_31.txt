=subject map to transform arrays in Perl 6

Hi again,

still in 2014 :)

As a response to my previous post wondering if 2015 is going to be the "year of Perl 6"
but Raiph Mellor also pointed us to article Larry Wall wrote on 24 December for
the Perl 6 Advent calendar:

http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/day-24-seeing-wrong-right/

It's worth reading, but let me also quote it here:

"Either way, it doesn't really matter, because there's no stopping Perl 6 now. After a few final tweaks,
sometime in 2015 we'll finally be at a point where we can just decide when to tag the next release as 6.0.0.beta.
And maybe we'll keep it in beta until 2015-12-25 or so."

So it might be time to start the engines.

I am enthusiastic as usual, and this time I plan to stick to it for a few months to see if things get picked up.
You can certainly help my spreading the word!


I've started to relearn Perl 6, started to update the slides on the Perl 6 Maven site.
Even adding new ones:


Transform arrays and list using map

I'll understand if you don't have time to read it this year, but the next one is close.
