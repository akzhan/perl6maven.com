=subject Most popular shell commands using Perl 6

Hi,

A few weeks ago brian d foy posted a challenge to create
a list of most popular shell commands. Assuming of course
a Linux/Unix system and using Perl.
I think he did not explicitly say Perl 5 :)

I wrote a version in Perl 6 that can also handle Windows machines:

Enjoy
