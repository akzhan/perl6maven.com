=subject Echo text with Bailador

In this article I continue what I started earlier:

http://perl6maven.com/getting-started-with-bailador

and create a new route to echo back text the user types in a form:

http://perl6maven.com/echo-text-with-bailador

(It also involved some patching of Bailador).


Earlier article I forgot to e-mail
==================================

I am not sure why, but apparently I've forgotten
to send e-mail for two articles I posted in the last couple of days:


How to get the size of a file in Perl 6
http://perl6maven.com/how-to-get-size-of-a-file-in-perl6

and

Current Working Directory in Perl 6 (cwd, pwd, $*CWD)
