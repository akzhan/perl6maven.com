=subject Getting started with Rakudo * (2013.01) on Windows

hi,

a few days ago I rebuild Rakudo on my Linux machine, but I
also wanted to try it on Windows. I am glad that the
Rakudo team already provides MSI file for easy installation
on Windows.

In this article I described my experience with the most recent
MSI package and explained how to fix the minor flaws I found.

Perl 6 Maven social widgets
===========================

Last time I mentioned that I added the social icons to the tutorial pages,
but it turns out they were broken for most of the time.
I fixed them now so you can +1 the articles on Google+.
I am sure it does not need explanation that Google takes the +-es
and the number of shares in account for the regular searches as well.


enjoy
