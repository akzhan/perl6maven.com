=subject Bailador Application in a module

Hi,

a new article creating a Bailador Application in a module
http://perl6maven.com/bailador-app-in-a-module

and I've also started to add documentation of Bailador to
the main page: http://perl6maven.com/bailador

I hope by the time of YAPC::EU, this will become a really usable framework.
Your questions and suggestions would be appreciated!


regards
  Gabor
