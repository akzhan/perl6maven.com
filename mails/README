Emails were sent using

   perl6 -Ilib script/sendmail.pl6 mails/file.tmpl   perl6@szabgab.com

and then they need to be approved via the Mailman interface.

The emails can be sent from either the desktop of Gabor or the server.

but for now I just copy-paste the content of the files to my e-mail client and send them manually.
