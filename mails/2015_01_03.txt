=subject Running external commands from Perl 6 (shell, QX)

As I was just told on the perl6-users mailing list
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2015/01/msg1879.html
(subscribe at http://perl6.org/archive/lists/ )
the features is currently being discussed, but if you would like to
run some external program, you can already use either the shell or the QX functions.

I tried to describe them in this article:
