=subject How to catch an exception in Perl 6

Hi there!

I know it was only 2 days ago that I restarted this newsletter
and now I am here again.

This is that small project I mentioned in the previous message.
I started to write it and as I re-learn Perl 6, I will post
my questions, and the answer I found in relatively short posts.

It probably won't have any logical order.

Anyway, the title of this mail is the title of the post:

Reminder: Perl 6 Advent Calendar
===================================

Instead of reading my short articles, you'd probably gain
a lot more following the Perl 6 Advent calendar which is written
by people who actually know Perl 6:

It even has a table of contents:

enjoy!
