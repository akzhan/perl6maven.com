After <a href="/getting-started-with-bailador">getting started with Bailador</a> serving simple text,
we saw how we can accept input from the user and <a href="/echo-text-with-bailador">echo it back</a>, but we had the HTML
snippets embedded in our Perl 6 code. That can work for really small applications, but if we would like
to build a real web application we need to move the HTML out to externale template files.

Bailador user Template::Mojo as its default templating system.

<h2>Bailador web appication</h2>

In our example we use two files. One of them is the main Perl 6 script called <hl>app.pl6</hl>
and the other one is the <hl>views/echo.tt</hl> located in the <hl>views</hl> subdirectory:

<include file="bailador/echo_template/app.pl6" />

The application has 3 routes. The <hl>/</hl> route returns an HTML snippet still embedded in the Perl 6 code,
displaying a link to the <hl>/echo</hl> page.

Then there are two <hl>/echo</hl> routes. One that will handle the GET request to this URL, that returns the
content of the template, the other one that will pass the value of the <hl>text</hl> field of the HTML form
to the template engine.

One important thing to mention. In order to know whre the root of the application is and from there to deduct
where the <hl>views</hl> directory is, Bailador makes some calculations in its <hl>import</hl> function.
As of this writing Rakudo 2015.07 does not automatically call this function thus after loading Bailador
we had to include a call: 

<code lang="perl6">
Bailador::import;
</code>

<h2>Template::Mojo</h2>

The template itself is basically a subroutine in which the first line accepts the parameters from
the call to the <hl>template</hl> function. (Except that the name of the template file is not passed to the template
engine. Only the hash atfter it.

<code lang="perl6">
% my ($h) = @_;
</code>

Lines in the template that start with <hl>%</hl> are considered Perl 6 code.
Snippets that that are embedded in <hl>&lt;%=  %&gt;</hl> tags are values interpolated
in the HTML document:

<code lang="perl6">
% if $h<text> {
	You said <%= $h<text> %>
% }
</code>

The full template looks like this.

<include file="bailador/echo_template/views/echo.tt" />

We can run <hl>perl6 app.pl6</hl> which will launch a small web server on port 3000. We can then visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/
and follow the link to <hl>Echo</hl> where we'll see the form to be filled.
