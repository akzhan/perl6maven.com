=abstract start

A few week ago we saw how to <a href="/rakudo-perl6-with-docker">get started with Perl 6 in a Docker container</a>.
Since then a new version of <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Star</a> was release (version 2017.04) and I wanted to see
how can I upgrade it.

In a nutshell: I need to start from scratch.

=abstract end

Assuming you have followed the instructions <a href="/rakudo-perl6-with-docker">using Docker with Perl 6</a> you can restart the Docker container again:

<code>
docker start rakudo && docker attach rakudo
</code>

and then run <hl>perl6 -v</hl> to see the version of Rakudo:

<code>
root@5367bca6f844:/# perl6 -v
This is Rakudo version 2017.01 built on MoarVM version 2017.01
implementing Perl 6.c.
</code>

It is out of date as the most recent release of Rakudo Star was 2017.04

<h2>Upgrade Docker Image</h2>

Let's start by listing the Docker images we have on the system:

<code>
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
rakudo-star         latest              8b00c91fa5c0        7 weeks ago         334 MB
</code>

Use the <hl>pull</hl> command to fetch the newer version of the already downloaded image:

<code>
$ docker pull rakudo-star
</code>

Then check the images again:

<code>
docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
rakudo-star         latest              118af315b797        5 weeks ago         338 MB
rakudo-star         <none>              8b00c91fa5c0        7 weeks ago         334 MB
<code>

<h2>Remove old image</h2>

At this point I tried to remove the old image, but Docker did not let me do it:

<code>
$ docker rmi 8b00c91fa5c0
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete 8b00c91fa5c0 (must be forced) - image is being used by stopped container 5367bca6f844
</code>

So I listed all the Docker containers I had:

<code>
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
5367bca6f844        rakudo-star         "bash"              56 minutes ago      Exited (0) 5 seconds ago                        rakudo
4af6f99aab3d        rakudo-star         "perl6"             About an hour ago   Exited (0) 54 minutes ago                       cocky_lalande
</code>

and removed them:

<code>
$ docker rm 5367bca6f844 4af6f99aab3d
</code>

Then I could remove the old and outdated image:

<code>
$ docker rmi 8b00c91fa5c0
</code>

<h2>Start new Docker image</h2>

At this point I basically have a clean system. The Docker image is already here, but
all the installation I did are gone. So I start from scratch launching a new Docker container:

<code>
docker run -it --name rakudo -v $(pwd):/opt rakudo-star bash
</code>

Then checking the version of Perl 6:

<code>
root@fcc044e9bb30:/# perl6  -v
This is Rakudo version 2017.04.3 built on MoarVM version 2017.04-53-g66c6dda
implementing Perl 6.c.
</code>

So we have the newer version now.

<h2>Install additional packages and Perl 6 modules</h2>

Then we can install the additional Linux packages we might need:

<code>
# apt-get update
# apt-get -y upgrade
# apt-get -y install less make gcc
</code>

and the Perl 6 modules we wanted for our experimental Perl 6 code.

<code>
# zef install Terminal::Readsecret
</code>
