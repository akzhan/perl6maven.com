Some people consider Perl 6 as the next major version of Perl, others think it is a sibling of
Perl 5 in the family of Perl languages.

Some people think this is the most awesome thing since sliced bread (and ice, before that),
others think it is doomed.

Some people think it is a research project that Perl 5 should steal from, other think it is
just a toy for some clever people.

Some people think it will be never finished, others are already using it on a daily base.

<h2>What is a Maven?</h2>

According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven">Wikipedia</a>,
<i>a maven (also mavin) is a trusted expert in a particular field, who seeks to pass knowledge on to others.</i>

I like that. I'd like to help <b>you</b> become a Perl 6 Maven.

If you are among the people who are interested where Perl 6 goes, join me in this adventure.

I used to write about <a href="http://szabgab.com/perl6.html">Perl 6</a> on my personal
web site and most of the material is still there, but I am going to move over all
the Perl 6 related material to this site.
