=abstract start

<hl>push</hl> treats the supplied parameters as individual entities and pushes them onto the original array without flattening them.

<hl>append</hl> (introduced new after 2015.09 release) will flatten the supplied array - if there was only one array supplied,
but will reat them as individual entities if more than one arrays are supplied.
