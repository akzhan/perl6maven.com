<h2>push</h2>

<hl>push</hl> treats the supplied parameters as individual entities and pushes them onto the original array without flattening them.

Both when we push one array:

<include file="examples/push_array.pl6" />

and when we push multiple arrays:

<include file="examples/push_2_arrays.pl6" />

<h2>append</h2>

<hl>append</hl> will flatten the supplied array if there was only one array supplied.

<include file="examples/append_array.pl6" />

It will treat them as individual entities if more than one arrays are supplied:

<include file="examples/append_2_arrays.pl6" />

<h2>push and append of scalars</h2>

If we <hl>push</hl> or <hl>append</hl> individual elements to an array,
they will be used as elements of that array:

<include file="examples/push_array_scalars.pl6" />
