One of the biggest limitation of Perl 6 is the lack of access to the wealth of the
<a href="http://cpan.org/">Perl 5 CPAN</a>. This does not mean though that
there are no CPAN-like modules for Perl 6. There are a few, and some of them even work.

According to the latest count, there are over 100 modules available. Let's see how can we
install them.

<h2>Overview</h2>

In the current system each package must have a Github repository. There are no releases.
The installer fetches the latest from Github.

The official <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/">list of modules</a> has a one-line explanation
of each module and a link to their Github repository.

There is not a lot of <a href="/projects">module documentation</a>, but whatever there is, is processed and displayed on
the Perl 6 Maven site.


<h2>Installation</h2>

Currently the best tool to install Perl 6 modules is <a href="https://github.com/tadzik/panda/">Panda</a>
written by <a href="http://ttjjss.wordpress.com/">tadzik (Tadeusz So≈õnierz)</a>.

Assuming you already have <a href="/starting-again-with-rakudo-perl6">Rakudo installed</a>, you can install
Panda by following these steps:

<code>
git clone https://github.com/tadzik/panda.git
cd panda
perl6 bootstrap.pl
</code>

This should install a few modules and Panda itself to <hl>~/.perl6</hl> on Linux
and to <hl>c:\Users\USERNAME\.perl6</hl> on Windows.

You have to change the <hl>PATH</hl> environment variable to include the <hl>~/.perl6/bin</hl> directory.

Then you should be able to run <hl>panda list</hl> to list all the available modules
and <hl>panda install HTML::Template</hl> to install the Perl 6 implementation of HTML::Template.

When you encounter installation problems, please report them either via the Perl 6 IRC channel
or via the Perl6-users mailing list. Check the <a href="http://www.perl6.org/community/">Perl 6 community</a>
page for details.
