Every time there is a regex operation a localized version of 
the match variable $/ gets set to the actual match. 
That variable has a lot more power than simply containing the match.
We'll talk about that later but for now see this example

What was printed there, when printing the
result of a regex match?
$/ holds the match and is printed automatically
but it could be also printed by itself:

<include file="tutorial/regex2/match_object.p6" />

<pre>
$/.from  starting position of the match
$/.to    end position of the match
$/.chars number of characters matched
$/.Str   matched text
$/.orig  original matched string
</pre>
