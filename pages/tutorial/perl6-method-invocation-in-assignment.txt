In Perl 6 it extends to the . operator that allows the call
of methods on objects. Consider the following example.
The subst method can substitude one substring by another one
but instead of changing the original string, by default it returns
the changed string.

If you'd like to change the original string you can write
<emp>$str = $str.subst('B', 'X');</emp>
or you can write its shortcut version.
