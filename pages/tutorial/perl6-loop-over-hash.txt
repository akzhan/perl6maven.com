The same way we can loop over keys of a hash - after
fetching them using the "keys" function.


The declaration of hashes in Perl 6 is similar to that in
Perl 5 but when access individual elements in the hash it
now keeps the % prefix. Thus the value of the key "Foo" will
be  %phone{"Foo"}. Similarly if $name contains "Foo" we can
use the %phone{$name} expression to get back the relevant value.


As mentioned earlier the string interpolation of hashes requires
curly braces around the statement.

<include file="tutorial/hash/loop_over_hash.p6" />

Output

<include file="tutorial/hash/loop_over_hash.p6.out" />
