That would be the time to show how to define a subroutine
that can get arbitrary number of values, but that requires
introducing two concepts at a time. So I'll have to
find a better set of examples.


Anyway, if we would like to implement a sum() subroutine
that can get any number of values we need to define it like this:

<include file="tutorial/subroutines/slurpy_argument.p6" />

That is, we have to say that the expected parameter is a slurpy array.
The * means it is slurpy, the @ still means it is an array.
It will then accept any value as parameter and put them in the @values
array.


So I can call it either with literal scalars
or even with a list of arrays and scalars mixed
