of course the above regex will match things
that are not phone numbers as well:

<include file="tutorial/regex2/end_of_string_anchors_needed.p6" />

<ul>
  <li>^ always matches the beginning of the string</li>
  <li>$ always matches the end       of the string</li>
  <li>+ (and *, ?) are the same quantifiers as earlier</li>
</ul>

<include file="tutorial/regex2/end_of_string_anchors.p6" />

On the other hand if you'd like to match beginning 
or end of line, those are  ^^ and $$. So no need
for special mode for this.
Also if you want to match a newline you can use \n
and if you want to match any character except newline
(the old meaning of .) then just use \N.
