This won't match as there are more words

<include file="tutorial/regex2/matching_word_fails.p6" />

so we need to add a regex for the separators , and spaces
and we put the whole thing in a [] which is a (non-capturing)
grouping, apply a quantifier on that but we also need
to add another word matching regex for the last word

<include file="tutorial/regex2/match_several_words.p6" />

It could be also written this way:
The generic quantifier can also get
a separator on its right hand side.
