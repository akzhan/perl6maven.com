Reversed operators will reverse the meaning of the two operands.
So instead of switching the two arguments as in   $b cmp $a
one can write $a Rcmp $b.

It is not yet implemented in Rakudo and frankly I don't yet see
any use of it but I am sure others will.


I wonder if the same would also work on operators such as gt ?
Could I use   $x Rgt $y meaning $y gt $x ? Why is that good?
