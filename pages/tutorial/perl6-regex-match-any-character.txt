The . (dot) is a meta-character that will be ready to match 
any character.

As opposed to the Perl regular expressions in Perl 6 this includes
newlines

If you want to match any character except newline you can use the 
\N special character class.

There are also some non-alnum characters that
have special meaning though their meaning might 
be (a bit) different than in PCRE:
A . can match any character. Even newline.
