In shell scripts cat is usually used to read in a file to be processed by other tools
in Perl 6 you can slurp in a file:

<code>
my @rows = "data.txt".slurp;
my @rows = slurp "data.txt";
</code>

but you can also read them as one sting:

<code>
my $file = slurp "data.txt";
</code>

It is also used to its original purpose - to concatenate several files -
UNIX: cat a.txt b.txt > new.txt

Perl 6:
<code>
my $out = open "new.txt", :w err die "Could not open new.txt";
$out.say("a.txt".slurp)
</code>

<!--
The problem - in this case - with slurp that it automatically removes newlines
"input.txt".slurp.grep:{/\d\d\d\d}.say("output.txt");
-->
