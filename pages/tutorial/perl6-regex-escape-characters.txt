An important change from the way the reular expressions worked in Perl 5
is that in Perl 6 any non-alphanumeric character needs to be escaped.
Even if they don't currently have any special meaning or
you'll get a "Statement not terminated properly" error during 
compilation. In a way this will make all the regexes look less clean
as we will seen a lot more character escaping but it might force us
to pick cleaner solution even if they are more wordy.

So for exmple we will have to escpe the = sign or the dash: - .

To allow further extension of the regexes
Any other non-alnum character must be escaped:

<include file="tutorial/regex2/escape_characters.p6" />

We will have to be very careful as there are going to be a number of cases
that can easily trip up anyone who already uses regular expressions.
For example the pound key # is now a special character by default meaning a comment.

So you'd better escape it when you really mean to match a # character.
