Things in () separated by commas are called a list of things. Actually you don't even need the parentheses for the list, it just clarifies precedence.
A list is an ordered set of scalar values.
Examples of lists:

<include file="tutorial/arrays/list_literals.p6" />

We actually don't even need the parentheses in most of the cases.
