The same can be used with functions so instead of writing
<emp>my $lower = min($lower,  $new_value);</emp>
you can write
<emp>$lower min= $new_value;</emp>

<include file="tutorial/arrays/assignment_function_shortcuts.p6" />

This should even work with the comma operator effectively pusing more
values on an array but it is not yet implemented in Rakudo

<code>
my @a = (1, 2, 3);
@a ,= 4;
@a.say;
</code>
