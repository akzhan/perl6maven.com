In order do define a subroutine in Perl 6 we use the "sub" keyword.
Then comes the name of the subroutine with a list of parameters.
After that comes a block that implements the subroutin where you
can use the variables defined in the signature.

In the most simple case shown in the example we have two scalar variables
($a and $b) as parameters. In this case the parameters are required.
The user of the sub has to supply them though there are several way to do that.


The simple way is just to provide the in the same order as they are shown
in the signature.


The most basic example I usually show is the add function with
two parameters. That's usually enough in Perl 5 but very
far from that in Perl 6.


Positional parameters:

<include file="tutorial/subroutines/required_params.p6" />

Then if you try to call this with 3 parameters like this:

<code>
say add(2, 3, 4);
</code>

Rakudo will throw a run-time exception as it cannot
find the appropriate function.
