One should ask the question what happens if the list runs out of
values in the middle, of a multi-value iteration? That is,
what happens to the follow loop?

<include file="tutorial/arrays/missing_values.p6" />

In this case Rakudo throws an exception when it finds out it
does not have enough values for the last iteration. It will look
like this, (with a bunch of trace information afterwards).

<include file="tutorial/arrays/missing_values.p6.output" />

In order to avoid the exception we could tell the loop that the second and
subsequent values are optional by adding a question mark after the variable

<include file="tutorial/arrays/missing_values_fixed.p6" />

This will work but generate the following output:

<include file="tutorial/arrays/missing_values_fixed.p6.output" />
