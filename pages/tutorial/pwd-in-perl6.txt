In Perl 6 the special variable <b>$*CWD</b> contains the current working directory
as an instance of the <a href="http://doc.perl6.org/type/IO%3A%3APath">IO::Path</a> class.

=abstract end

You can just use that variable as and even if you change directory using the <a href="/tutorial/cd-in-perl6">chdir</a>
function, the <b>$*CWD</b> variable will be up-to-date.
