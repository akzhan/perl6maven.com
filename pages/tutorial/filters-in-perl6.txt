In shell script we don't usually read in a file to memory, instead we do
several passes on the same file in order to extract data.


In a high-level language such as Perl 6 we can read in all the content of the
file and have better ways to fetch verious pieces of information. This ease
is of course only relevent for files that can fit into memory. If we have
to deal with files larger than the free memory in the computer we cannot
read all of it into memory so either we have to do several passes on a file
or make our algorithm more clever.
