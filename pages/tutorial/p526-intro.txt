While there are many similarities between Perl 5 and Perl 6 there are also a few
substantial changes. This chapter tries to ease the transition for Perl 5 programmers
to Perl 6.

In this chapter you won't find strongest operators of Perl 6. What I am trying to
show here is that given a Perl 5 program how one can more-or-less straight forward
translate it to Perl 6.
