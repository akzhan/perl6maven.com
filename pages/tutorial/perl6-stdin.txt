Ask the user what's her name

When prompting the user with a question it is probably the best to use the <emp>prompt</emp> function.
Similarly to <emp>say</emp> it prints to the screen, but without the newline at the end.
Then it waits for the user to type in something.

It reads up to the ENTER the user presses, but passes over only the the part before the
newline. (Perl 5 users could think about it as having autochomp)
