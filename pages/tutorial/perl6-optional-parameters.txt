<code>
    multi sub process_template($input, %params?) {

    multi sub process_template($input, $output, %params?) {
</code>

If we defined our functions that way we could call

<code>
    process_template("from.tmpl", "to.html");
</code>

and it would know how to find the right subroutine leaving
the %params hash empty.

Side note: this part is not yet implemented so the above code
won't yet work.

There is a lot more one can do with signatures but I think
this is enough for today.


Question mark (?) after the variable name means it is an optional varible.

<code>
    multi sub process_template($input, %params?) {
</code>
