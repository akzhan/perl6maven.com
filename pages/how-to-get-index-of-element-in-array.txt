=perl5title How to get the index of specific element (value) of an array?

=abstract start

Given an array like this:

<code lang="perl6">
my @levels = <TRACE DEBUG INFO WARNING ERROR FATAL>;
</code>

and give one of the names, e.g. 'DEBUG', how can we know which element is it?

=abstract end

In Perl 6 it is easy. There is a method called <b>grep-index</b> that will return the index of the matching element.

<include file="array_element_index_grep.pl6" />

The <b>WHAT</b> method here revealed that the <b>grep-index</b> method actually returns a List. That's especialy usefule
if the same element appears more than once. In that case <b>grep-index</b> will return the list of all the indices
and if we want, we can access each individual index using square brackets:

<include file="array_element_index_grep_duplicate.pl6" />


<h2>index</h2>

I was a bit surprised to see that the plain <b>index</b> method converts the array into a string and
returns the location of the value passed to it within that string:

<include file="array_element_index.pl6" />
