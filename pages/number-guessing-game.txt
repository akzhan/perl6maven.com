=perl5title Number guessing game in Perl 5

=abstract start

This is the Perl 6 solution to the <a href="http://code-maven.com/exercises">exercise</a> which is the beginning of a game called
the <a href="http://code-maven.com/exercise-number-guessing-game">Number Guessing game</a>.

=abstract end

<include file="examples/number_guessing.pl" />

Perl 6 has a function called <a href="http://doc.perl6.org/routine/rand">rand</a> to generate random numbers,
but as I was told, the idiomatic way to generate random integers is to
<a href="http://doc.perl6.org/routine/pick">pick</a> them from a range or to
<a href="http://doc.perl6.org/routine/roll">roll</a> a dice.

Once we have the <hl>$hidden</hl> value we use the <a href="http://doc.perl6.org/routine/prompt">prompt</a> function
to ask for the user input.

Unlike in <a href="http://code-maven.com/number-guessing-in-ruby">Ruby</a> or in <a href="http://code-maven.com/number-guessing-in-python">Python</a>
Perl does not require special conversion of the input to a number. We can go directly to the look at the 3 cases and provide
the appropriate feedback to the user.
