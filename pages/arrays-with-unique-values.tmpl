How to get rid of duplicate values in an array in Perl 6?

=abstract end

<h2>Arrays with unique values</h2>

Basically they show various ways how one can take a list
of values and return a sublist of the same values
after eliminating the duplicates.

With Perl 6 its quite easy to eliminate duplicate values from a list as there
is a built-in called <hl>uniq</hl> that will do the job.

<code lang="perl6">
use v6;

my @duplicates = (1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1);
say @duplicates.perl;           # Array.new(1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1)


my @unique = uniq @duplicates;
say @unique.perl;               # Array.new(1, 2, 5, 4, 3)
</code>

This works on strings as well:

<code lang="perl6">
use v6;

my @chars = <b c a d b a a a b>;
say @chars.perl;        # Array.new("b", "c", "a", "d", "b", "a", "a", "a", "b")

my @singles = uniq @chars;
say @singles.perl;      # Array.new("b", "c", "a", "d")
</code>


<h2>Perl 6 Comments</h2>

A few comments to people new to Perl 6:

One should start every Perl 6 script by asking for v6;
version 6 of Perl. It is important in order to avoid
strange error messages when you happen to run it with
perl 5.

You can add  <hl>.perl</hl> to every kind of variable and get
back a dumped representation of the data in it. Very handy for debugging.

<hl>say()</hl> is a built-in function in Perl 6 and it behaves as
say() in Perl 5.10, printing to the screen and adding
a newline at the end.

Angle brackets < > allow one to create a list of
values from a space separated list of items. In Perl 5
the qw() operator was used for this.

<h2>Method calls</h2>

Actually <hl>uniq</hl> can also be used as a method call on the
array object...

<code lang="perl6">
use v6;

my @chars = <b c a d b a a a b>;

my @singles = @chars.uniq;

say @singles.perl;    # Array.new("b", "c", "a", "d")
</code>

... and some people will prefer to add the .say method call
at the end of the expression:

<code lang="perl6">
@singles.perl.say;
</code>

though I think this isn't as clear as having the say at the beginning.
