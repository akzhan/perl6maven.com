<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> is a service that offers Continuous Integration on Linux to open source project hosted on GitHub free of charge.

<a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">Appveyor</a> offers similar service on MS Windows.

A while ago I wrote <a href="/continuous-integration-for-perl6-modules-using-travis-ci">how to set up Travis-CI for Perl 6 projects</a> and 
recently brian d foy wrote <a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/2017/04/02/rakudo-star-on-appveyor/">Rakudo Star on AppVeyor</a>
and later updated it with 
<a href="https://www.learningperl6.com/2017/05/01/rakudo-in-chocolatey-makes-appveyor-easier/">Rakudo in Chocolatey makes AppVeyor easier</a>.

In a nutshell, there are easy instructions on how to add Continuous Integration to Perl 6 based GitHub repositories.

<h2>Module list</h2>

The <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/">Perl 6 modules list</a> has two columns indicating the status of each module
on Travis, and whether the Appveyor was configured. (No Appveyor status yet.)

This makes it easy for the potential volunteer to spot the modules that have not been configured to use either one of those.

Actually a volunteer would better focus on modules that have been updated recently.
Let's say in the last half a year. There is a much bigger chance with those modules that a contribution to
them will be accepted in a timely manner.

Luckily the <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/#sort-col=5&sort-dir=d">module lists</a> can be ordered by most
recent activity.

So if you would like to contribute a bit to the Perl 6 ecosystem, helping an author to configure
either or both of those CI systems could be a tremendous help with a relatively little effort.

You just need to set them up in your clone and then send a
Pull-Request to the authors so they can also enable Travis and Appveyor
and merge your .travis.yml and appveyor.yml files.
